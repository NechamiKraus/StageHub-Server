# 🎭 Show Management System – Server

This is the backend (server-side) of a full-stack web application designed to manage theatrical shows. The system supports user registration, practice scheduling, file management, and ticket booking, providing a centralized platform for various roles involved in show production.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The system provides role-based functionalities for the following user types:

- **Simple User**: Can view upcoming shows and purchase tickets.
- **Director**: The owner of a show, responsible for managing actors, coaches, providers, practices, and shows.
- **Coach**: Works under a director to prepare actors for the show.
- **Actor**: Participates in practices and performs in shows.
- **Provider**: Supplies essential products (e.g., costumes, sound equipment) for the show.
- **Manager**: Oversees the entire system and registers new directors.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This server is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, with MongoDB as the database. Authentication is role-based and enforced using middleware.

### Main Components

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and route logic for different user roles.
- **Services**: Contain business logic for each user type.
- **Middleware**: Includes authentication to enforce role-based access.
- **Models**: Define MongoDB schemas (e.g., for uploaded files).

## 🛡️ Authentication

All endpoints are protected by role-based middleware:
```js
checkAuth("role")
```
Roles include:
- `"simple"`
- `"director"`
- `"coach"`
- `"actor"`
- `"provider"`
- `"manager"`

Middleware ensures only authorized users can access role-specific routes.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT or role-based middleware
- **File Uploads**: `multer` with in-memory storage to MongoDB
