# üé≠ Show Management System ‚Äì Server

This is the backend (server-side) of a full-stack web application designed to manage theatrical shows. The system supports user registration, practice scheduling, file management, and ticket booking, providing a centralized platform for various roles involved in show production.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The system provides role-based functionalities for the following user types:

- **Simple User**: Can view upcoming shows and purchase tickets.
- **Director**: The owner of a show, responsible for managing actors, coaches, providers, practices, and shows.
- **Coach**: Works under a director to prepare actors for the show.
- **Actor**: Participates in practices and performs in shows.
- **Provider**: Supplies essential products (e.g., costumes, sound equipment) for the show.
- **Manager**: Oversees the entire system and registers new directors.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This server is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, with MongoDB as the database. Authentication is role-based and enforced using middleware.

### Main Components

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and route logic for different user roles.
- **Services**: Contain business logic for each user type.
- **Middleware**: Includes authentication to enforce role-based access.
- **Models**: Define MongoDB schemas (e.g., for uploaded files).
